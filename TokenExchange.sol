// This code defines a smart contract named "TokenExchange" that allows users to exchange their TerraFly tokens for other loyalty program miles.
// It has a variable partnerAddress to keep the address of the partner.
// It has a mapping userTokens to keep track of the exchanged tokens by user and partner.
// It has an ERC20 variable terraFlyToken to keep the reference to the TerraFly token contract.
// The contract has a constructor that takes in the address of the partner and the ERC20 token contract as input. The partner address is used to check if the user is trying to exchange with a valid partner. The ERC20 token contract is used to check the user's TerraFly token balance before exchanging.
// The exchange function takes in the address of the partner and the amount of TerraFly tokens the user wants to exchange as input. It checks if the user has sufficient TerraFly tokens, if the input is valid and if the partner address is valid. If all checks pass, the contract calls the exchange method of the partner's loyalty program contract to exchange the TerraFly tokens for loyalty points. The exact method call will depend on the specific loyalty program's contract.
// The burn function takes in the amount of TerraFly tokens the user wants to burn as input. It checks if the user has sufficient TerraFly tokens, if the input is valid. If all checks pass, the contract burns the TerraFly tokens.
